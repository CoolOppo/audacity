<p>
Audacity includes many built-in effects and also lets you use
plug-in effects (VST plug-ins) on the Macintosh and Windows
formats.

<p>
To apply an effect, simply select part or all of the tracks you want
to modify, and select the effect from the menu.  Titles which end in
an ellipsis (...) will bring up a dialog asking you for more parameters.

<ul>

<li><b>Amplify...</b>: 
This effect increases or decreases the volume of a track or set of
tracks.  When you open the dialog, <b>Audacity</b> automatically
calculates the maximum amount you could amplify the selected audio
without causing clipping (from being too loud).<p>

<li><b>Bass Boost...</b>:
This is a safe, smooth filter which can amplify the lower frequencies
while leaving most of the other frequencies alone.  It is most effective
if you don't try to boost too much; 12 dB is usually just right.<p>

<li><b>Echo...</b>
A simple delay line.  For this to be effective, you may want to
add silence to the end of your track(s) first so that there's plenty
of time for the echo to die out gradually.<p>

<li><b>Fade In</b>
Applies a linear fade-in to the selected audio.  For a logarithmic
fade, use the envelope tool.<p>

<li><b>Fade Out</b>
Applies a linear fade-out to the selected audio.  For a logarithmic
fade, use the envelope tool.<p>

<li><b>FFT Filter...</b>
This effect is fully functional but the dialog box is unfortunately
still under construction.  You can still use it, but there are no
axes to tell you which frequencies are which, or how much gain you're
applying.
<p>
This is the most general type of filter.  If you're careful, you
can use it to highlight exactly the frequencies you want.
However, doing an FFT filter is more likely to result in
artifacts, especially if the filter you draw is not smooth.
<p>

<li><b>Noise Removal...</b>
This effect is ideal for removing constant background noise such as
fans, tape noise, or hums.  It will not work very well for removing
talking or music in the background.
<p>
Removing noise is a two-step process.  In the first step, you select
a portion of your sound which contains all noise and no signal,
in other words, select the part that's silent except for the noise.
Then choose <b>Noise Removal...</b> from the Effect menu and click
Get Profile.  Audacity learns from this selection what the noise
sounds like, so it knows what to filter out later.
<p>
Then, select all of the audio where you want the noise removed from
and choose <b>Noise Removal...</b> again.  This time, click the
"Remove Noise" button.  It may take a few seconds or longer depending
on how much you selected.
<p>
If too much or not enough noise was removed, you can <b>Undo</b>
(from the Edit menu) and try <b>Noise Removal...</b> again with a
different noise removal level.  You don't have to get a new noise
profile again if you think the first one was fine.
<p>
Removing noise usually results in some distortion.  This is normal
and there's virtually nothing you can do about it.  When there's only
a little bit of noise, and the signal (i.e. the voice or the music or
whatever) is much louder than the noise, this effect works well and
there's very little audible distortion.  But when the noise is very
loud, when the noise is variable, or when the signal is not much
louder than the noise, then the result is often too distorted.
<p>
Future versions of Audacity may include improved versions of this
effect.
<p>

<li><b>Phaser...</b>
Spice up your sound effects!
<p>

<li><b>Wahwah...</b>
Just like that guitar sound so popular in the 1970's.
<p>
<br>
<p>

<li><b>Plug-ins:</b>
To use a VST plug-in effect, put the effect in the directory (folder)
called "VST", which should be in the same directory where Audacity
resides.  If there is no directory called VST, create one.  The next
time you launch Audacity, any plug-ins you added will appear in the
Effect menu.<p>

</ul>
